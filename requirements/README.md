`requirements385.txt` is a requirements file I use on niagara (python 3.8.5)
`requirements3.8.10.txt` is what I use on my mac because niagara doesn't understand 
`requirements_full.txt` is for higher version of python and I'll probably delete it soon. 
`requirements.txt` is minimal thingy that mohan has, it doesn't include everything but at least we can be sure it's not bloated. As far as I can tell it's the only one not generated by running `pip freeze > req...txt`

Whenever you pip install something it also gets dependencies, which can lead to bloated requirements files, esp if you delete something you no longer needâ€”it's deps may still exist and bother you.
