You may need to install llvm. Try the following:
`brew install llvm`
`brew install libomp`

If that doesn't work make sure llvm and libomp are properly linked.
Try adding the following to your bash profile (or .zshrc or .bashrc):

```
# Add llvm to path
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/bin" # lib or bin?

# C include path for omp, installed with `brew install libomp`
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/16.0.6/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/16.0.6/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/16.0.6/include:$LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/16.0.6/include:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Try same for llvm lib
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/lib:$PATH"
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/lib:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/lib:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

But with the appropriate paths for your versions of llvm and libomp.
